# 广义可加模型 {#Generalized-Additive-Models}

广义可加模型（Generalized Additive Models，简称 GAM 模型）在 R 中的实现

- **gam** [@R-gam]实现了《Statistical Models in S》[@Chambers1992] 中描述的所有广义可加模型
- **mgcv** [@Wood2017]
- **gss** [@Gu2014jss]
- **mda** [@R-mda]



## Are GAMs implemented in R

Package gam from CRAN implements all the Generalized Additive Models (GAM) functionality as described in the GAM chapter of the White Book. In particular, it implements backfitting with both local regression and smoothing splines, and is extendable. There is a gam() function for GAMs in package mgcv, but it is not an exact clone of what is described in the White Book (no lo() for example). Package gss can fit spline-based GAMs too. And if you can accept regression splines you can use glm(). For Gaussian GAMs you can use bruto() from package mda.
